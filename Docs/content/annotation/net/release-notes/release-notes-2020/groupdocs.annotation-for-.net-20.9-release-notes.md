## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
Removed the deprecated ImportAnnotations property from the LoadOptions class because annotations are imported automatically.

So, if before version 20.9 this code was correct:

```csharp
Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.docx", new LoadOptions { Password = "password", ImportAnnotations = true });
```
#
Beginning with version 20.9, LoadOptions no longer has the ImportAnnotations property. The previous code needs to be changed. Example:


```csharp
Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.docx", new LoadOptions { Password = "password" });
```
