## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes
From this time Annotation Models overload the standard Equals method and also implement the IEquatable interface with the type of the class from which this method is called.

Example how to use it:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated_file.pdf"))
{
	var annotations = annotator.Get();
	ImageAnnotation imageAnnotation = new ImageAnnotation
	{
		Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100),
		Opacity = 0.7,
		PageNumber = 0,
		ImagePath = "www.google.com.ua/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_92x30dp.png",
		Angle = 100
	};
	foreach (var annotation in annotations)
	{
		if (imageAnnotation.Equals(annotation))
		{
			// Do some stuff here...
		}
	}
}
```
