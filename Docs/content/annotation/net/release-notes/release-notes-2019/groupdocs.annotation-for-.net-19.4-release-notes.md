## Public API and Backward Incompatible Change

{{< alert style="info" >}}This section lists public API changes that were introduced in GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET 19.4.

Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

1.  Adding Link annotation.  
    Minimal set of fields for Link Annotation. This type of annotation supported for Slides, Words and PDF documents
    
    ```csharp
    AnnotationInfo link= new AnnotationInfo()
    {
       Box = new Rectangle(173.2986, 154.3131, 142.5, 9),
       //URL
       FieldText = "https://www.google.com",
       SvgPath = "[{"x":173.2986,"y":687.5769},{"x":315.79859999999996,"y":687.5769},{"x":173.2986,"y":678.5769},{"x":315.79859999999996,"y":678.5769}]"
       Type = AnnotationType.Link;
    };
    ```  
    
2.  GetPdfFile method can process documents with password.  
    If you need to process document protected with password you should pass extra parameter for GetPdfFile method
    
    ```csharp
    Stream convertedDocument = annotator.GetPdfFile(protectedDocument, "123password123");
    ```
