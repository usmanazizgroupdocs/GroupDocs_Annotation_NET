Every time you are saving file using [Annotator.Save()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator/methods/save/index) method - you implicitly create a new version of the annotated file. Versions list stores not document, it keeps annotations that you add, remove, and change. So you can easy swap between different changes made with GroupDocs.Annotation. And of course you can set your version names.

By default, they are created using unique GUID keys. Next, each aspect of using versions will be considered. The API execution logic has not changed, so you do not need to change your code to use it as before. The latest version of document is loaded by default. 

### Backward Compatibility

The update is fully compatible with previous and next updates (The latest saved version will be used), however, using versions on previous versions is not possible and the list of versions in this document will not be changed. And If you update file from 20.4+ using 20.2 and lower few times, after loading this document on 20.4+ only last changes will be added as new version.

### Add Version with custom name

If you want to swap between versions easily you might need to have ability to set custom versions names.

  
Here the code that demonstrates how to save version with custom name:

```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("input.pdf"))
{
	annotator.Update(new AreaAnnotation{ Box = new Rectangle(100, 100, 100, 100) });
	annotator.Save("result.pdf", new SaveOptions { Version = "CUSTOM_VERSION" });
}
```

Type of [Version](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.options/saveoptions/properties/version) property is object, so it support any type, and you can use any variable as version variable

# Get List of All version keys on a document
If you don't know what versions were added earlier or want to know versions count 
Here the code that demonstrates how to get list of versions keys, you could do this calling [GetVersionsList](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator/methods/getversionslist) method of [Annotator](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator):
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("result.pdf")) { 
      List<object> versionKeys = annotator.GetVersionsList();
}
```
{{< alert style="info" >}}
[Annotator.GetVersionList()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator/methods/getversionslist) returns list of objects because it supports any type of key. But if you used some specified keys as string - you can convert it.

# Get List of Annotations using version key
If you need to get list of annotations you can use [Annotator.GetVersion()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator/methods/getversionslist) method
Here code that demonstrates how to get list of annotations from specific version of document
```csharp
using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("result.pdf"))
{
    List<AnnotationBase> annotations = annotator.GetVersion("CUSTOM_VERSION");
}
```
{{< alert style="info" >}}
[GetVersion](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation/annotator/methods/getversionslist) supports any type, and you can use any variable as version.
{{< /alert >}}
# Load Document of custom Version
Using [LoadOptions.Version](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/groupdocs.annotation.options/loadoptions/properties/version) property you could load specific version of annotated document
Here the code that demonstrates how load version using version property:
```csharp
 using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator($"result.{ext}", new LoadOptions { Version = "CUSTOM_VERSION" }))
{
	annotator.Save("result_loaded.pdf");
}
```
